                                                    state, so that they can control education and experience

                                                    have a central authority to resolve consumer problems. The
                                                    terminology used
                                                    to identify real estate professionals varies a little from state to
                                                    state.
                                                    Brokers are generally required to have more education and experience
                                                    than
                                                    real estate salespersons or agents. The person you normally deal
                                                    with is a
                                                    real estate agent or salesperson. The salesperson is licensed by the
                                                    state,
                                                    but must work for a broker. All listings are placed in the broker’s
                                                    name,
                                                    not the salesperson’s. A broker can deal directly with home buyers

                                                    sellers, or can have a staff of salespersons or agents working for
